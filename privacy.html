                        We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Website. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, 
                        such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Website and other technical information. 
                        This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Website, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.<wbr><br><br>
                        Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.<wbr><br><br>
                        The information we collect includes:<wbr><br>

                                Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and settings and information about your activity in the Website 
                                (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports 
                                (sometimes called 'crash dumps') and hardware settings).
                            </li>

                                <em>Location Data.</em> We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Website. 
                                For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. 
                                Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

                        (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days.<wbr><br><br>
                        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, 
                        if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

                        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. 
                        However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, 
                        so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. 
                        Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.

                        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. 
                        At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. 
                        If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
